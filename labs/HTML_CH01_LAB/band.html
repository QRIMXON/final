<p>HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the underlying protocol used
    by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted,
     and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands</p>
     <dl><dt><b>HTTPS</b></dt></dl>
     <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a variant of the standard web transfer protocol
    (HTTP) that adds a layer of security on the data in transit through a secure socket layer (SSL) or 
    transport layer security (TLS) protocol connection.</p>

    <p>Domain Name Servers (DNS) are the Internet's equivalent of a phone book. They maintain a directory
         of domain names and translate them to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. This is necessary because, 
         although domain names are easy for people to remember, computers or machines, access websites based on 
         IP addresses</p>
