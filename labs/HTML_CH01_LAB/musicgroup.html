    <P><b>1017 Brick Squad is a record label started by Gucci Mane. Gucci and Waka have experienced the most commercial
        success with Webbie hot on their heels, though he has recently fallen into obscurity. It could be argued Waka Flocka 
        has as well, however he still does extremely well over seas. It would seem Gucci Mane was the Alpha and Omega
        of the group as he has experienced the most commercial success, is considered an absolute god father in the rap genre,
        and has had one of the notably longer careers in the rap industry as a whole.

        <b><dt>Gucci Mane: The State vs. Radric Davis</dt>
    <dd>This was honestly one of my favorite projects not just from Gucci, but the entire 1017 label. It is one
        of the most well received albums the group has ever produced.</dd>
        <dt>Waka Flocka: Lebron Flocka James</dt>
        <dd>This was the absolute break out album for Waka. I will never forget the time in my life when this CD dropped,
            as Gucci's legacy had already paved an inlet for Waka to take advantage of, and Waka grabbed that chance and flew
            with it. Hit single "Hard In The Paint" defined Waka's original hard hitting sound and he was considered a classic
            ever since.</dd>
            <dt>Gucci Mane: Trap House</dt>
            <dd>Last but far from least is Trap House, Gucci Mane's very first full length album. What people don't 
                realize is this album is one of the first pop culture references to multiple terminologies that have
                become cemented into American culture, giving birth to not only the term "trap house" but also "trap music".
