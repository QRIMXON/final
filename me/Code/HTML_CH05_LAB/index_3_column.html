                                            <h3>Get A Check Up</h3>
                                            If you have any health issues or take any medications, be sure to consult
                                             with your healthcare provider before beginning a new exercise or diet
                                              regimen.</p>
                                            
                                           <h3>DressFor Success</h3>
                                            Workout clothes should be comfy. While exercising, you should be thinking
                                             about what you're doing, not what you're wearing. That includes good shoes, 
                                             which are essential for running, jogging, or walking, and socks that absorb 
                                             shock and sweat.</p>
                                            
                                           <h3>Equipment?</h3>
                                            You don't need to buy a lot of fancy equipment to get in shape. 
                                            But you might want to invest in a yoga mat, a large exercise ball,
                                             or some weights, depending on your Shape Up! plan.</p>
                                            
                                           <h3>Resist Temptation</h3>
                                            It's hard to eat right when everyone else is buying lunch at a fast food
                                             restaurant. Invest in some good food containers and bring your healthy
                                              lunch and snacks. Your body and your wallet will thank you.</p>
